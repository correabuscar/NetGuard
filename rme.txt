this has my mods on a different branch: git branch

the keystore AND key passwords are a minimum of 6 chars pwd each!

the file: keystore.properties can be just this(exactly):
storeFile=storeFilePath
storePassword=
keyAlias=
keyPassword=


How to BUILD:

Build->Clean Project
Build->Refresh Linked C++ Projects (just to be sure)
Build->Rebuild Project

then

Build->Generate Signed ... APK
choose APK from the two, `Next`,
point to keystorepathfile.jks as the Key Store path
use min 6 char passwords for both `key store password` and for `key password`
the key alias is same "key0"
`Next`
pick "debug" of the 3, `Create`

then:
adb push ./app/debug/NetGuard-v2.329-debug.apk /storage/emulated/0/Download
adb kill-server
