this has my mods on a different branch: git branch

the keystore AND key passwords are a minimum of 6 chars pwd each!

the file: keystore.properties can be just this(exactly):
storeFile=storeFilePath
storePassword=
keyAlias=
keyPassword=


How to BUILD:

Build->Clean Project
Build->Refresh Linked C++ Projects (just to be sure)
Build->Rebuild Project

then

Build->Generate Signed ... APK
choose APK from the two, `Next`,
point to keystorepathfile.jks as the Key Store path
use min 6 char passwords for both `key store password` and for `key password`
the key alias is same "key0"
`Next`
pick "debug" of the 3, `Create`

then:
adb push ./app/debug/NetGuard-v2.329-debug.apk /storage/emulated/0/Download
adb kill-server

after installing it via package manager or package installer, to keep xiaomi from not killing it, you've to do 4 things:
1. while started press the square button on bottom left to see all tabs(so to speak) and add/tap the lock so it's kept open, or something.
2. hold tap on it while on (1) above, and tap the round settings, go to "Battery saver" set it to "No restriction" of the 4 variants.
3. find "Background autostart" in settings (or via Activity Launcher app aka de.szalkowski.activitylauncher) and find NetGuard there set it to enabled, so it can start on startup (this makes xiaomi less likely to kill it)
4. open the "Battery optimization" activity (probably via Hidden Settings app aka com.cyhan.sets, because this shortcut is hidden) and find NetGuard there, tap it, you see 2 things "Optimize" and "Don't optimize", make sure it's set to "Don't..." - WARNING tho, this resets to "Optimize" every time you turn off then on again the button in NetGuard, probably because com.miui.powerkeeper is marking it as such, instead of marking com.android.updater as such because that's the evil one that uses all the battery and you've to keep stopping it manually else it uses 350+mA constantly (instead of the 150mA that it does when true idle at 10% cpu usage constantly).
5. make sure NetGuard is in Auto Close app's Whitelist so it doesn't get killed by Auto Close.
6. add NetGuard to app lock so you're prompted for pwd when accessing it, in android settings search for 'app lock' then enable the toggle for NetGuard
7. after turning on NetGuard, go into android settings for VPN and turn on both option for Always On VPN and for Block connections without VPN (seems to work fine with android 13 or so)
