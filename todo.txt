* (can't)cache the rcode 3 DNS responses, even those we made rcode 3 ourselves! so far only normal replies are cached! and add the default TTL from the UI to the cached values.
  Can't really cache these, since the caching happens in Android OS, it seems, so it doesn't cache negative responses, thus apps will keep querying those NXDOMAIN hosts. An alternative might be to keep them as 0.0.0.0 thus cached, then, somehow detect via NetGuard when dest is 0.0.0.0 and block that, or drop the packet(drop is bad, incurs timeout and delays), but most likely this won't work(my guess) because before the packet is sent, linux kernel will replace that daddr 0.0.0.0 with either localhost IP or same IP as source IP (if source IP wasn't 0.0.0.0 as well), thus, NetGuard won't see 0.0.0.0 as daddr to block it.
  Another way would be to drop the app/OS-sent dns query if NetGuard can see it, as it knows it's a host that returned rcode 3 (aka NXDOMAIN) before (it has its own cached list but has no bearing, apparently, on DNS) but this means, I'd have to figure out how to tell NetGuard to filter DNS requests which it presumably does none at all currently, as per FAQ. And after the drop, send a NG-made reply with NXDOMAIN. And by drop I mean, definitely don't sent it over the internet!
